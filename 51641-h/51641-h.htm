<h2><i>Advice to Andrew Jackson by His Mother</i></h2>
<p>In 1781 Andrew Jackson, then fourteen years of age, enlisted in
the American Army; was captured and thrown into prison, where
he had smallpox. His mother, Elizabeth Hutchinson Jackson, through
exchange, arranged for his release and nursed him back to health.
Responding to an urgent appeal, she left him to go to Charleston to
nurse some sick neighbors who were confined there on a British hospital
ship. This errand of mercy cost her life. She caught yellow fever
and died.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Almost her last words to her young son were:</p>
<p><i>Andrew, if I should not see you again, I wish you to remember
and treasure up some things I have already said to you. In this
world you will have to make your own way. To do that, you
must have friends. You can make friends by being honest, and
you can keep them by being steadfast. You must keep in mind
that friends worth having will in the long run expect as much
from you as they give to you. To forget an obligation or to be
ungrateful for a kindness is a base crime&mdash;not merely a fault
or a sin, but an actual crime. Men guilty of it sooner or later
must suffer the penalty. In personal conduct be always polite
but never obsequious. None will respect you more than you
respect yourself. Avoid quarrels as long as you can without
yielding to imposition. But sustain your manhood always.
Never bring a suit in law for assault and battery or for defamation.
The law affords no remedy for such outrages that can satisfy
the feelings of a true man. Never wound the feelings of others.
Never brook wanton outrage upon your own feelings. If ever
you have to vindicate your feelings or defend your honor, do it
calmly. If angry at first, wait until your wrath cools before you
proceed.</i></p>
</blockquote>
<p>These words were repeated by General Jackson on his birthday,
March 15, 1815, at New Orleans, to three members of his military
family: Major John H. Eaton, Major William B. Lewis, and Captain
W. O. Butler. &ldquo;Gentlemen,&rdquo; said General Jackson, &ldquo;I wish she could
have lived to see this day. There never was a woman like her. She
was gentle as a dove and as brave as a lioness. Her last words have
been the law of my life.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Andrew Jackson, seventh President of the United States,
gave the name &ldquo;Hermitage&rdquo; to his home. In his inspiring
memory it is preserved.</p>
<div class="divp"><h3><i>Youth</i></h3>
Andrew Jackson was of Scotch-Irish lineage. His parents
were of the rugged pioneer type that throughout America
helped to lay the foundation of a great republic. He was born on
March 15, 1767, in what was known as the Waxhaws Settlement,
near the line between North and South Carolina. There has been
some dispute as to which of the two States could claim him. Some
authorities appear to have definitely settled that at the time of his
nativity the Waxhaws Settlement constituted a part of South
Carolina, but that now Jackson&rsquo;s birth site is comprehended in
Union County, North Carolina. Jackson always gave South Carolina
as his birth state.</div>
<p>Andrew Jackson&rsquo;s father, for whom he was named, died several
days before he was born. His mother, Elizabeth Hutchinson Jackson,
to whom tribute should be paid as a truly remarkable woman,
<span class="pb" id="Page_4">4</span>
heroically met the hard situation of rearing and educating her three
small sons. Young Andrew was nourished in the Revolutionary
sentiment, which was rife in the late sixties and early seventies,
bursting into flame in 1775. He and his mother and brothers were
patriots from the inception of the Revolutionary movement. These
fires of patriotism in the Waxhaws were fanned by the fact that
there was much Tory sentiment. When in August, 1776, a newspaper
reached the Waxhaws carrying the Declaration of Independence
young Andrew Jackson, then in his tenth year, was called
upon to read it to an assemblage. In 1781, at the age of fourteen,
he enlisted with the South Carolina forces and was later made
prisoner and struck down by a sword in the hands of a British
officer whose boots he refused to black. His two brothers also
enlisted in the war and gave up their lives. His mother, as a
result of a mission service to Charleston to nurse prisoners from the
Waxhaws there on shipboard, contracted yellow fever and died.
At the successful end of the struggle of the Colonies young Andrew
Jackson, in his fifteenth year, emaciated from desperate prison illness,
found himself alone in the world, an orphan of the Revolution.</p>
<div class="divp"><h3><i>Early Career</i></h3>
After completing his schooling, Jackson began the
study of law. In 1786 he was licensed at Salisbury,
N. C., and in 1788 went to Jonesboro, now in Washington County,
Tenn., then in North Carolina. After a brief career at Jonesboro
he received an appointment as U. S. Attorney for the Western
District of North Carolina with headquarters at Nashville. He
reached Nashville in 1788. He took an active part in Public Affairs
and was a member of the Convention that framed the Constitution
of Tennessee. In 1796, when Tennessee was admitted to
the Union, he was chosen as the first Representative of the new
state to Congress. A year later he was appointed to the United
States Senate, and after a short service he resigned and subsequently
became a member of the Superior Court of Law and Equity, holding
this position until 1804, when he resigned to devote himself to
personal affairs.</div>
<div class="divp"><h3><i>Military</i></h3>
Andrew Jackson was Major-General of Tennessee Militia
from 1802 to 1814. It was in the War of 1812 that
Jackson became a national figure. This war was the inevitable
<div class="pb" id="Page_5">5</div>
sequence of the Revolutionary War. It was occasioned by the
conduct of England in restricting our commerce, impressing into
her service seamen from our ships, acts of contempt intolerable to
a free people. It has been called in apt phraseology the War OF
American Independence in contra-distinction to the Revolution,
which was FOR American Independence. Andrew Jackson, as
Major-General of Tennessee Militia, threw himself into the conflict.
He inaugurated a campaign against the Creek Indians, who,
allied with the British, had been stirred to deeds of atrocity, the
most revolting of which was the massacre at Fort Mimms, Alabama,
on August 30, 1813. After a series of smaller engagements,
General Jackson, finally, on March 27, 1814, overwhelmingly defeated
and crushed the Creek Indians at the Great Horseshoe Bend.
Two months later, May 31, General Jackson was made Major-General
of the United States Army, with command of the Southern
and Western Divisions.</div>
<div class="divp"><h3><i>New Orleans</i></h3>
No sketch of Andrew Jackson, however brief, can
fail of emphasis on the Battle of New Orleans, for it
was his marvelous victory over the greatly outnumbering, confident,
invading British Army on January 8, 1815, that first gave
him national renown and made him a popular idol and hero. It
came at a time when the national spirit was at its lowest ebb, as
a result of a long series of land defeats, and sent a wave of exultant
joy throughout the country. It was a complete and decisive victory.
Historians agree that it was a brilliant victory, but many of
them, and unfortunately school histories, present the view that the
battle was fought after peace and was unnecessary. This has been
exposed as an error. The State of Tennessee in 1927 appointed a
commission to make research into the real value of the battle of
New Orleans, and this commission submitted report to the Governor
who transmitted it to the Legislature of 1935. This report
has been published by the Ladies&rsquo; Hermitage Association and is
kept on sale at the Hermitage. It shows by quotation from the
document itself that the treaty of Ghent, signed by the commissioners
of the contending countries December 24, 1814, specifically
provided that it should be effective when ratified by both sides,
and that it was not ratified by the United States until February 17,
1815, forty days after the battle at New Orleans. The report
<div class="pb" id="Page_6">6</div>
further shows by evidence of records that the battle saved the
Louisiana Purchase, or another war with England. It shows also
that the battle reestablished national integrity or peace from within.
The importance of the battle can hardly be overestimated, viewed
either from the immediate effects or the aftermath. The Ladies&rsquo;
Hermitage Association in 1935 joined with the National Daughters
of 1812 and other patriotic entities in calling for revision of school
histories to accord with revealed facts.</div>
<p>The victory at New Orleans, one of the most decisive defensive
victories of history, will always be celebrated as an illustrious
feat of the American arms and of the military genius of Andrew
Jackson. Jackson mobilized incongruous elements, every available
resource, into defense against the enemy attack. The forces thus
assembled, consisting of Tennessee militia, Kentucky militia, Louisiana
militia, and small contingents of regulars, Baratarian privateers,
free men of color, Mississippi Dragoons, and friendly Choctaw
Indians, numbered in all a little over five thousand. The invading
army consisted of about twelve thousand seasoned British regulars.
The British soldiers fought bravely, as British soldiers always do,
but they could not stand against the well-planned, unerring fire
from the American breastworks. The assault continued for twenty-five
minutes, and then the British retreated in confusion, having
lost in killed, wounded, and captured over twenty-five hundred
of their number, including General Pakenham, chief in command,
and General Gibbs, second in command, both having been killed.
The American loss was put at thirteen killed and wounded. On
the west bank of the river the British succeeded in capturing a
small redoubt, but owing to the catastrophe of the main attack,
this was abandoned.</p>
<p>Jackson was too prudent to yield to the impulse to pursue the
retreating enemy, which he knew still outnumbered him by two
to one, but kept in readiness against a return assault. The British
ten days later broke camp and retired to their ships, and on January
28 set sail for the Dauphine islands. Jackson maintained himself
in constant readiness against possibility of a return attack.</p>
<div class="divp"><h3><i>The Judge Hall Fine</i></h3>
As illustrative of Jackson&rsquo;s character or
one phase of that remarkable character,
brief mention is here given to the incident known as the Judge
Hall fine. When General Jackson began organizing for the defense
<div class="pb" id="Page_7">7</div>
of New Orleans he put the city and environs under strict martial law.
While this was irksome to the civil authorities it was acquiesced in
because of the dire necessities of the situation. Rigid martial law
was continued after the battle of January 8, and after the departure
of the British from our shores. General Jackson took no chances
of being caught unprepared in case of another attack. Some time
in February a delegation was sent to the British fleet to arrange
some exchanges. They reported upon return that a passing ship
had brought the news of the agreement upon the peace treaty by the
commissioners at Ghent. General Jackson refused to abrogate
martial law, saying the news might be a British trick, or even if
true the treaty must be ratified, and that in any event he would
await official dispatches from the Government. A pamphlet appeared
offensively criticizing the continuance of martial law.
Authorship was traced to a member of the legislature. General
Jackson had the offender arrested for spreading sedition in the camp.
The prisoner applied to Federal Judge Hall for a writ of habeas
corpus, which was granted. Thereupon General Jackson had
Judge Hall also arrested and conveyed outside the martial law
jurisdiction. When later (about March 13) official word came
of the ratification of the treaty with proclamation of peace, martial
law was lifted. Judge Hall returned and cited General Jackson
to appear before him on the charge of contempt of court. General
Jackson, in civilian dress, responded. He was followed to the
court room by a large crowd of sympathizers. The judge showed
uneasiness, fearing a mob. General Jackson, mounting a seat, said:
&ldquo;There is no danger here&mdash;there shall be none. The same hand
that protected this city from outrage by the invaders of the country
will shield and protect this court or perish in the effort.&rdquo; Judge Hall
imposed a fine of a thousand dollars which General Jackson promptly
paid. When he left the courthouse a demonstrative populace took
the horses from his carriage and conveyed him in triumphal way
to his dwelling place. A public subscription was started to pay the
amount of the fine, but General Jackson halted it. In 1843, six
years after Jackson had retired from the Presidency, Congress
refunded the fine plus six per cent interest. This incident is given
as one distinct refutation of the charge so frequently made by
Jackson&rsquo;s enemies that he was lawless, that he knew no law but his
own will. From this instance, occurring at a crucial time in his
<div class="pb" id="Page_8">8</div>
career, the conclusion, which may be generally interpretative, is
manifest that Jackson, no matter how autocratic in authority, no
matter how intolerant of cross current interference, when occasion
for authority ceased, submitted to, with readiness if necessary to
defend, the civil institutions of his country.</div>
<div class="divp"><h3><i>Interim</i></h3>
In 1817 and 1818 General Jackson conducted a successful
campaign against the Seminole Indians. His operations
carried him into Spanish territory and international trouble was
feared. It, however, happily ended in the cession by Spain to us of
Florida. General Jackson was appointed Governor of this territory,
but after a brief service resigned and returned to the Hermitage.</div>
<p>In 1823-24 General Jackson again represented Tennessee in the
United States Senate. In 1824 he was a candidate for President
of the United States and received a plurality of the votes in the
electoral college, but no candidate having received a majority,
under the Constitution the election went to the House of Representatives,
where John Quincy Adams was chosen.</p>
<div class="divp"><h3><i>The President</i></h3>
In 1828 General Jackson was elected President,
after a campaign marked by much bitterness.
He received 178 electoral votes, and John Quincy Adams 83.
In 1832 he was overwhelmingly re-elected, receiving 219 electoral
votes. Henry Clay received 49, John Floyd 11, and William Wirt 7.</div>
<p>His administrations were the first to be classed as &ldquo;Democratic.&rdquo;
Those of Washington and John Adams were known as &ldquo;Federal,&rdquo;
those of Jefferson, Madison, Monroe, and John Quincy Adams as
&ldquo;Democratic-Republican.&rdquo;</p>
<p>General Jackson&rsquo;s two administrations were marked by the
force and power of his great personality. One of his memorable
achievements was his prompt and effective dissipation of the cloud
that hung over the Union when South Carolina sought to nullify
the Tariff Act, which her citizens claimed was oppressive. President
Jackson&rsquo;s great proclamation in this crisis electrified the nation.
South Carolina repealed the nullification act. Another outstanding
feature of President Jackson&rsquo;s administration was his veto of the
act passed by Congress to re-charter the United States Bank.
Congress declined to pass the bill over his veto, and the Bank went
out of existence as a Federal institution at the expiration of its
twenty-year charter in 1836. President Jackson, by direct instruction
in October, 1833, caused the removal of the Government&rsquo;s
<span class="pb" id="Page_9">9</span>
deposits from the U. S. Bank. This led to the establishment
of the sub-treasury system, by which the government became the
custodian of its own money and disbursed it in accordance with
specific appropriations by Congress. The removal of these deposits
from the U. S. Bank created a great furor. It was resented by the
Bank and its friends. The U. S. Bank, operating under charter
from Congress, was undoubtedly a strong political factor. It
was the head of what was called the money power, and represented
an opposition so strong that no public man in America, save Andrew
Jackson, could have overcome it. An adverse Senate, under the
leadership of Messrs. Clay, Calhoun, and Webster, adopted a
resolution March, 1834, censuring the President for the removal of
the public money from the U. S. Bank. The resolution provoked
great resentment among the followers of Jackson throughout the
country. Many States, through their Legislatures, instructed their
Senators to vote to expunge the unwarranted resolution from the
Senate records. On January 16, 1837, after a prolonged debate,
in which Clay, Calhoun, and Webster sought to stem the tide, a
majority of the Senate voted to strike from the record the offensive
resolution. Then and there the journal of June, 1834, was produced
and the Senate&rsquo;s Secretary drew heavy ink lines around the resolution
and wrote across the face thereof the words, &ldquo;Expunged by
order of the Senate.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In December, 1834, President Jackson announced the extinguishment
of the public debt.</p>
<p>In 1835, one Richard Lawrence, afterwards pronounced insane,
attempted to assassinate President Jackson on the steps of the
Capitol. The brave-hearted President rushed upon his assailant
with uplifted cane, exclaiming: &ldquo;Let me get to him, gentlemen;
I am not afraid.&rdquo; He would not desist until the would-be assassin
was overpowered.</p>
<p>March 4, 1837, General Jackson ended his notable administration
as Chief Magistrate, leaving a Government practically free from
debt and the country in a highly prosperous condition. He retired
to his beloved Hermitage, which became a mecca for the leaders of
his party. He continued to exercise a potent influence upon the
affairs of the nation until his death, June 8, 1845.</p>
<p>The direction which Andrew Jackson gave to our national life
and the marked impress he made upon it are still manifest. In
<span class="pb" id="Page_10">10</span>
every crisis his memory has been, and is still being, invoked as an
inspiration to courage, honesty, and patriotism.</p>
<h3>DOMESTIC</h3>
<p>General Jackson&rsquo;s wife was Rachel Donelson. She first contracted
a marriage with Lewis Robards, who lived in the territory
of Kentucky, then under the jurisdiction of Virginia. The marriage
was not a happy one and she returned to her paternal home near
Nashville. Robards presented a petition for divorce to the Legislature
of Virginia, alleging desertion. At that time Legislatures
passed upon and granted divorces. The news came in 1791 that
the divorce had been granted. Later in the year Jackson and Mrs.
Robards were married. It subsequently developed that the Virginia
Legislature had not granted the divorce outright, but had
authorized a court in the Kentucky territory to do so upon hearing
of the facts. The divorce was not made effective until late in 1793.
Immediately thereafter in 1794 Jackson and his wife were remarried.
While this irregularity was without intent on the part of either,
it was in after years used as the basis of attack upon Jackson by his
political enemies, being especially stressed by them in the acrimonious
campaign of 1828. These attacks were met by a plain statement
of the facts to the country by Judge Overton, General Jackson&rsquo;s
close friend and one-time law partner.</p>
<p>The attacks gave deep distress to Mrs. Jackson, who was a
truly good and noble woman and greatly beloved by all who knew
her. One of the outstanding features of General Jackson&rsquo;s life
was his tender devotion to her. After her death this devotion
continued to her memory until he was laid by her side. It was
given beautiful expression in the epitaph which he himself wrote and
which is carved upon her tomb in the Hermitage garden. No
student of Jackson should fail to read and reread this epitaph.</p>
<p>Mrs. Jackson died December 22, 1828, just after her husband&rsquo;s
election to the Presidency. As he sat at her bier, he said: &ldquo;What
are all the world and its honors to me since she is taken from me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>A great demonstration planned in Nashville in celebration of
Jackson&rsquo;s election was cancelled on account of Mrs. Jackson&rsquo;s death.</p>
<p>General and Mrs. Jackson had no children. In 1809 they
adopted the infant son of Severn Donelson, brother of Mrs. Jackson,
and named him Andrew Jackson, Jr. He bore that name and became
heir to all the estate.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_11">11</div>
<div class="divp"><h3><i>An Appraisal of Jackson</i></h3>
Many volumes have been devoted to Andrew
Jackson and probably many more will be written.
He looms bigger and bigger in perspective.
Andrew Jackson was absolutely and rigidly honest.</div>
<p>He was absolutely without fear, having not only superb physical
courage but moral courage of the same degree.</p>
<p>He was intensely patriotic, and having been cradled in the
Revolution in which as a boy he took part, he was imbued with
the underlying spirit of that conflict, and carried that spirit throughout
his life and expressed it in his acts.</p>
<p>He agreed with Thomas Jefferson&rsquo;s construction of the fundamental
purposes of government and became an active, dynamic exponent
of Jefferson&rsquo;s democratic ideals; for example, believing in the doctrine
of special privileges to none, with his first message to Congress
he began the fight against renewal of the charter of the United
States Bank, then grown into a great financial and political power,
and continued until he finally destroyed that beneficiary of privilege.</p>
<p>He had what might be called a dominating personality, inspiring
a devoted and confident following, as is the case with a leader
who always knows just where he is and why he is there; he had an
iron will which surmounted difficulties and mastered his own physical
infirmities.</p>
<p>He had at times a violent temper, but it was always subject to his
will.</p>
<p>He had the power of forming quick, comprehensive, and just
judgment, and the faculty of putting judgment once formed into
immediate execution.</p>
<p>In manner he was considerate and scrupulously courteous, being
called by one writer the most polite gentleman in the world.</p>
<p>The rare devotion of his friends and those nearest in contact to
him gives attestation to a warm and kindly nature, probably
nothing giving stronger evidence of this nature than the letters
of fatherly advice written from the White House to his youthful
ward, Hutchins.</p>
<p>His messages are among the strongest papers of all the Presidents,
breathing lofty statesmanship and patriotism inspiring to all who read.</p>
<p>His two terms as President marked a distinct advance in popular
government, and ushered in a new era.</p>
<p>No appraisal of Jackson could be complete without inclusion
of reference to the military phase of his remarkable career. His
<span class="pb" id="Page_12">12</span>
military genius was little short of marvelous. It aimed at and
achieved success in every campaign he commanded. It gives
him rank as one of the greatest generals of our history. It was
conspicuously and gloriously displayed in saving the Republic
at a critical hour. But that military genius was never exercised
except for his country&rsquo;s defense, being subordinated at all times to
high conception of his country&rsquo;s good. If, on the other hand,
he had loved military glory for that glory&rsquo;s sake, if he had been of
the Man-on-Horseback type, that genius and his powers of leadership
might have carried him far in the lists of the world&rsquo;s military
chieftains. We are told that Napoleon Bonaparte, during the
hundred days of his return from Elba, studied Jackson&rsquo;s defense of
New Orleans.</p>
<div class="divp"><h3><i>The Duel With Dickinson</i></h3>
The duel between General Andrew Jackson and
Charles Dickinson, in which the latter lost his
life, occurred May 30, 1806. Historians commonly
agree that the feeling between the two men had its inception
in remarks made by Dickinson concerning Jackson&rsquo;s marriage.
Dickinson was reputed to have said that Jackson was entitled to
great military honors because he had captured another man&rsquo;s wife.
Jackson taxed Dickinson with having made that statement and
Dickinson apologized, saying he must have been in his cups at this
time. While the incident thus passed, it is manifest that a spirit
of animosity was engendered between the two. Being gentlemen,
both were adverse to predicating a duel or fight upon a woman&rsquo;s
name. The duel had its ostensible origin in a projected horse
race which did not materialize. In 1805 Jackson was the owner of a
celebrated horse, Truxton, and in the autumn of that year a match
was arranged between Truxton and Ploughboy, a horse owned by
Captain Joseph Ervin, father-in-law of Charles Dickinson. The
stakes were $2,000 with a provision for a forfeit of $800 should
either horse fail to appear. Before the race Ploughboy went lame
and was withdrawn, Captain Ervin paying the stipulated forfeit in
certain notes. These notes became the subject of controversy in
which Dickinson entered. It seems manifest that Jackson believed
that Dickinson was a member of a clique in Nashville that wanted
to draw him (Jackson) into trouble.</div>
<p>The mock heroic challenge of one Thomas Swann, to which he
responded by a public caning of the challenger, Jackson regarded
as inspired by Dickinson, and in his letter to Swann (before Swann&rsquo;s
<span class="pb" id="Page_13">13</span>
challenge) he charged that Dickinson was the instigator. Dickinson
responded, using this language in conclusion: &ldquo;As to the word
&lsquo;coward,&rsquo; I think it is as applicable to yourself as to anybody I know.
And I shall be very glad when an opportunity serves to know in
what manner you give your &lsquo;anodynes,&rsquo; and hope you will take in
payment one of my most moderate cathartics.&rdquo; After sending this
letter Dickinson left for New Orleans, where he remained four
months. In the meantime Jackson had a newspaper controversy
with Swann, in which he did not hesitate to connect Dickinson with
Swann and to ascribe to them sinister motives. After Dickinson&rsquo;s
return he gave a communication to the press in which he denounced
Jackson as &ldquo;a worthless scoundrel, a poltroon, and a coward.&rdquo;
Jackson immediately challenged Dickinson to a duel, and the
challenge was accepted before the day ended. General Thomas
Overton was Jackson&rsquo;s second, and Dr. Hanson Catlet the second
for Dickinson. The meeting was arranged for Friday, May 30,
1806, at Harrison Mills on Red River, Logan County, Kentucky,
the hour being seven o&rsquo;clock in the morning. Here is the language
of the agreement: &ldquo;The distance shall be twenty-four feet, the
parties facing each other with their pistols down perpendicularly.
When they are ready, the single word &lsquo;Fire&rsquo; is to be given, at which
they are to fire as soon as they please. Should either fire before
the word is given, we pledge ourselves to shoot him down instantly.
The person to give the word to be determined by lot; also the choice
of positions. We mutually agree that the above regulations shall
be observed in the affair of honor depending between General
Andrew Jackson and Charles Dickinson, Esq.&rdquo; The place fixed
for the meeting was a long day&rsquo;s ride from Nashville and the duelists
were obliged to start about twenty-four hours in advance of the hour
set. Dickinson, in addition to his second, was accompanied by
a gay party of friends. On the journey he is said to have performed
feats with his pistol, which were related to Jackson and
Overton, who followed. After spending the night in neighboring
cabins both combatants were on the field at the hour appointed.
Overton won the right to give the word. As soon as
he called &ldquo;Fire,&rdquo; Dickinson shot and the dust arose from Jackson&rsquo;s
coat. While badly wounded, Jackson, with deliberation, aimed
and fired, and Dickinson reeled, shot through the body. He died
that night. Jackson was hit in the left breast. He suffered from
the wound at periods years afterwards.</p>

<h3>MRS. SARAH YORK JACKSON</h3>
<p class="center"><i>By</i> <span class="sc">Mrs. Walter Stokes</span></p>
<p>No history of the Hermitage could be complete without a
sketch of Mrs. Sarah York Jackson, the beloved daughter-in-law
of General Jackson. She was the daughter of Peter Stilley
and Mary Haines York, a wealthy shipowner of Philadelphia.
She and her two sisters were left orphans at an early age and
were educated at Miss Mallon&rsquo;s School for Young Ladies in Philadelphia.
Sarah was the second and most beautiful of the sisters
and always said she would never marry unless the President should
come courting. One day, while out walking, in the early spring,
she met a cousin of hers, a young army officer, in company with a
very handsome young man. The handsome young man proved
to be the President&rsquo;s son, Andrew Jackson, Jr. They were introduced.
It was love at first sight. The President approved, and
they were married in October, 1831, at the home of her sister, Mrs.
Joshua Lippincott, in Philadelphia, going immediately by carriage
to the White House in Washington, where a brilliant reception
was held in her honor, and where President Jackson received her
with the greatest affection and pride. At this reception she wore
the lovely wedding dress which is now on display in the National
Museum in Washington, with the costumes of the other mistresses
<span class="pb" id="Page_15">15</span>
of the White House. Her portrait was painted at this time by
Earl. The red velvet dress pictured is in the Hermitage museum.</p>
<p>This portrait hangs in the dining room at the Hermitage, of
which the accompanying picture is a copy. An old copy hangs
in the White House, of which she was mistress for some years,
a position which, by her natural grace and tact and great beauty,
she was eminently fitted to fill. All of her children were born at the
Hermitage, and the family was the solace and comfort of General
Jackson&rsquo;s declining years. She had grown dearer and dearer to his
heart and came next to his beloved wife, Rachel, who had died
when he was elected President.</p>

beloved wife, was the largest contributor to the building fund and always referred to it as
&ldquo;Mrs. Jackson&rsquo;s Church.&rdquo; In his latter years he was a faithful member, frequently arriving
before the service with his man servant to see that the fires were properly made. Two log
fireplaces were used for heat, home-made brick for flooring, and candles for lighting.</b></p>

<p class="pcap">The log cabin located at the northeast corner of the Hermitage grounds is part of the group
of log houses which comprised the original Hermitage, where General and Mrs. Jackson
resided from 1804 until 1819.</p>
</div>
<p>The first home in which Andrew Jackson and Rachel,
his wife, lived was at Poplar Grove. This tract of land was
bought by Andrew Jackson from Captain John Donelson, brother
of Mrs. Jackson, on April 30, 1793, for the sum of one hundred
pounds. In the deed its location is described as being &ldquo;on the
south side of Cumberland River in Jones&rsquo; Bend ... being the
lower end of a survey of 630 acres granted the said John Donelson
by patent....&rdquo;</p>
<p>When the Jacksons returned to Nashville from Natchez in the
early autumn of 1791 they made their home with Mrs. Jackson&rsquo;s
mother, Mrs. John Donelson, who lived on the opposite side of the
river from Jackson&rsquo;s property in Jones&rsquo; Bend, near the present
pike which leads from Nashville to Gallatin. Indian hostilities and
the long absences necessitated by Andrew Jackson&rsquo;s legal business
in the courts of both the Cumberland and the Holston settlements,
made it impossible for him to leave his bride in the home located
outside of the heavily fortified portions of the settlement. Sometime
between April 30, 1793, and the spring of 1794, however, a
<span class="pb" id="Page_17">17</span>
home was built at Poplar Grove and occupied. A letter of Andrew
Jackson&rsquo;s dated May 16, 1794, was headed &ldquo;Poplar Grove.&rdquo; Even
then Poplar Grove was not safe, for as late as September, 1794,
reports to the War Department state that five men were fired upon
by the Indians.</p>
<p>On March 7, 1796, Andrew Jackson bought the Hunter&rsquo;s Hill
tract of 640 acres from John Shannon for the sum of $700. The
Hunter&rsquo;s Hill house was located about two miles from the present
Hermitage mansion.</p>
<p>A little more than a month and a half after the sale of the Hunter&rsquo;s
Hill property, Andrew Jackson purchased the Hermitage estate.
On the twenty-third of August, 1804, he paid Nathaniel Hays
$3,400 for the 425-acre tract, &ldquo;with its appurtenances,&rdquo; which
was to become &ldquo;The Hermitage.&rdquo; This reference to appurtenances
supports the statement made in later years by Mrs. James K. Polk,
wife of the eleventh President of the United States, that the Hermitage
of the log cabin period &ldquo;was not the commodious country
house so familiar to devout Democrats in pilgrimages of later years.
It was a group of log houses in close proximity to each other. The
principal one had been built for a block-house in the days of Indian
alarms, afterwards used as a store and, about 1804, converted into a
dwelling. It, like all block-houses, was two stories high. Near
it were three smaller houses, one story high, with low attics. These
were used as lodgings for members of the family or guests.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Aaron Burr was entertained in these log buildings when he
made his famous visits to the Hermitage in 1805 and 1806, and
it was to this humble home that General Jackson returned after the
Battle of New Orleans (January 8, 1815), which had made him the
Conquering Hero and idol of the nation.</p>
<p>Sometime during 1818 the site of the brick mansion was selected
and the square house which forms the central portion of the present
building was erected. Diligent research by the leading Jackson
students of the nation has failed to reveal the exact date or details
of the construction of this building. It is generally agreed, however,
that it was completed in 1819 and was occupied when President
Monroe was a guest at the Hermitage in June, 1819. The Marquis
de Lafayette was entertained in this building in 1825, and many
other celebrities knew its hospitality. The simple, but commodious
<span class="pb" id="Page_18">18</span>
home was the center of the 1828 campaign which resulted in electing
Andrew Jackson to the presidency of the United States.</p>
<p>In 1831 wings and other improvements were added to the square
brick building which had been erected in 1818-1819. At this
time the present kitchen and smoke-house were built and the
tomb in the garden was erected. Three years later&mdash;October 13,
1834&mdash;fire destroyed much of the interior and the roof of the building.
The present dining-room wing, the kitchen, and out-houses
were not burned, however. With the exception of a few large
pieces on the second floor, all of the furniture, as well as General
Jackson&rsquo;s valuable papers, clothing, and gifts received after the
victory at New Orleans, were saved.</p>
<p>With the rebuilding the gabled roofs on the wings and central
portions of the building were changed to their present appearance
and the ten rather unattractive columns of the 1831 building gave
place to the present stately ones. The interior was also improved.
The mansion, as it stands today, was repaired and ready for occupancy
by May, 1835. The walls, being sturdily built in the
beginning, withstood the fire, making it necessary for only the woodwork
and the interiors to be rebuilt.</p>
<p>General Jackson died in 1845 at the age of 78 years, and was
buried by the side of his wife in the tomb in the garden.</p>
<p>The Hermitage Farm, of 500 acres, was sold by Andrew Jackson,
Jr., in 1856, to the State of Tennessee for the sum of $48,000.</p>
<p>Andrew Jackson, Jr., and his family then left the Hermitage, but,
at the invitation and solicitation of Gov. Isham G. Harris, returned
in 1860 to become its custodian until further disposition could be
made of the property.</p>
<p>The State of Tennessee offered the Hermitage to the United
States Government for a branch of West Point Academy, but
the Civil War prevented the consummation of the plan.</p>
<p>The family of the adopted son, Andrew Jackson, Jr., remained
at the Hermitage during the Civil War.</p>
<p>General George H. Thomas, commandant of the post at Nashville
during the Civil War, sent out a detailed guard to protect the place
and save it from devastation.</p>
<p>Andrew Jackson, Jr., died at the Hermitage in 1865, leaving
his widow, Mrs. Sarah Jackson, and her widowed sister, Mrs.
<span class="pb" id="Page_19">19</span>
Marion Adams, the sole occupants of the Hermitage. The daughter,
Rachel, had married Dr. John M. Lawrence, and all the young
men, the sons of Andrew and Sarah Jackson, also those of Mrs.
Adams, five in number, joined the Confederate Service. Only one,
Col. Andrew Jackson, returned.</p>
<p>The State Legislature allowed Mrs. Sarah Jackson to remain
tenant at will, during her life, at the Hermitage. She died in 1888,
her sister, Mrs. Adams, having preceded her to the grave. Both
are buried in the garden.</p>
<p>Col. Andrew Jackson, III, after serving gallantly as Colonel
of Artillery in the Confederate Army, returned, the only surviving
soldier of the Hermitage family, a released prisoner from Camp
Chase. He remained with his mother during her life and by her
will inherited the household furniture, mementoes, and relics of
the old hero. Colonel Jackson died in Knoxville, Tenn., December
17, 1906, and was buried in the Hermitage garden by the side of his
brother, Capt. Samuel Jackson. Andrew Jackson, IV, son of
Colonel and Mrs. Jackson, died in Los Angeles, California,
1953, and is buried in the Hermitage garden. His brother, Albert
Marble Jackson, was reputedly lost at sea.</p>
<h3>THE LADIES&rsquo; HERMITAGE ASSOCIATION</h3>
<p>Mrs. Andrew Jackson, III (Amy Rich), conceived the
idea of the Ladies&rsquo; Hermitage Association. The organizers
were Andrew Jackson, III, Mrs. Mary C. Dorris, Mr. and Mrs.
William A. Donelson.</p>
<p>On February 19, 1889, Mrs. Rachel J. Lawrence, Mary W. May,
Mrs. Mary Hadly Clare, Mrs. E. L. Nicholson, Miss Louise Grundy
Lindsley, Mrs. Henry Heiss, and Mrs. Mary C. Dorris applied to the
State of Tennessee and were granted a charter incorporating the
Ladies&rsquo; Hermitage Association. The objects of the Association
stated in the charter were to purchase from the State of Tennessee
certain land, including the residence and tomb of Andrew Jackson,
and to &ldquo;beautify, preserve, and adorn the same throughout all
coming years, in a manner most befitting the memory of that
great man, and commensurate with the gratitude of his countrymen.&rdquo;
The General Assembly of the State of Tennessee, on April 5,
1889, conveyed to Trustees for the Ladies&rsquo; Hermitage Association
<span class="pb" id="Page_20">20</span>
twenty-five acres of the Hermitage farm, including the house,
tomb, and surrounding buildings.</p>
<p>Dr. and Mrs. J. Berrien Lindsley rendered very efficient service
in securing from the State Legislature the original conveyance of
twenty-five acres to the Ladies&rsquo; Hermitage Association.</p>
<p>The General Assembly of the State of Tennessee (Chapter No.
27, Public Acts of Tennessee, 1923), at the earnest solicitation of
the Officers and Directors of the Ladies&rsquo; Hermitage Association,
conveyed 232&#8309;/&#8321;&#8320; acres of the Hermitage farm, located in the
Fourth Civil District of Davidson County, Tennessee, to the
Board of Trustees for the Ladies&rsquo; Hermitage Association, to the
end that said Ladies&rsquo; Hermitage Association be permitted and encouraged
to preserve and beautify same, so as to display the respect,
love, and affection which a grateful State and people cherish
for their illustrious hero and statesman, Andrew Jackson.</p>
<p>The General Assembly of the State of Tennessee in 1935, by
Public Act, conveyed 500 acres of the original Hermitage farm
tract to the Board of Trustees to be maintained under the care and
custody of the Ladies&rsquo; Hermitage Association. The Hermitage
farm is now under the supervision of the Ladies&rsquo; Hermitage Association
for preservation as a perpetual memorial. In 1960 the
Association acquired 125 acres adjoining the north boundary as
protection against future industrial or housing developments,
bringing the total acreage to 625.</p>
<p>The furniture and relics were in the Hermitage at the time of the
organization of the Ladies&rsquo; Hermitage Association in 1889, and Col.
Andrew Jackson gave the Association an option upon them. But
failing to raise the necessary money after four years&rsquo; trial, the entire
collection of relics and furniture was removed in 1893 by the
owner, Col. Andrew Jackson, to Cincinnati, where he had them on
exhibition for pay. This venture was not a success, so they were
returned to Nashville. From this collection and from various members
of the family and others, the Association has bought the relics
it now owns, that so beautifully adorn the residence where they
first were placed.</p>
<p>The Association in its early years put forth untiring efforts to
raise the funds necessary to restore the mansion and collect the
original furnishings and relics. It inaugurated various enterprises,
such as lectures, concerts, balls, etc.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_21">21</div>
<p>President Theodore Roosevelt visited the Hermitage, October
22, 1907, and in a speech then promised government aid. He incorporated
the matter in his annual message, and as a result and
through the efforts of Senator James B. Frazier and Congressman
John W. Gaines, both of whom were trustees, Congress made an
appropriation of $5,000 to repair and improve the Hermitage.
The present sources of revenue are admission fees, souvenir shop
sales, and Association membership dues.</p>
<p>The collection of relics and furniture now in the house is the result
of years of effort of the Ladies&rsquo; Hermitage Association. It is
interesting to note, in this connection, that the Hermitage is the
only great National Shrine in this country having original furnishings
throughout. All furnishings in the house originally belonged
to General Jackson, with the exception of a few articles which, in
each case, are noted in the catalogue.</p>
<p>In 1961, the National Park Service of the U. S. Department of
the Interior designated the Hermitage as a Registered National
Historic Landmark.</p>
<p>For forty-five years following the opening of the Hermitage to
the public, Mr. and Mrs. T. L. Baker served as careful and dedicated
custodians of the buildings and grounds. They were succeeded
by their son, Andrew Jackson Baker, who was born at the
Hermitage, and his wife, and it is due to their continued dedication
and interest that the Hermitage has maintained its reputation as
the nation&rsquo;s best-kept shrine. Due to ill health, Mr. Baker resigned
in 1963.</p>
<p>The present custodian is Steve S. Lawrence.</p>

<div class="divp"><h3><i>The Carriage House</i></h3>
In 1897, Col. Andrew Jackson, from whom
most of the relics were purchased, sold to
the Association the interesting old coach used by Jackson at the
White House for state, ceremonial, and social purposes and for
several trips to the Hermitage. The trip to the Hermitage took
thirty days&rsquo; time. His journeys were a continual ovation.</div>
<p>The skeleton of the phaeton is all that is left of the beautiful
vehicle presented to General Jackson by the &ldquo;Democratic-Republican&rdquo;
citizens of Philadelphia. It was made from timbers taken
from the old ship Constitution. The phaeton in which General
Jackson rode with Martin Van Buren to the latter&rsquo;s inauguration
was damaged by fire in Cincinnati, where the Jackson relics were
stored before being acquired by the Ladies&rsquo; Hermitage Association.

<h2 id="c4">MANSION AND GROUNDS</h2>
<p>The Hermitage is built in &ldquo;Southern Colonial&rdquo; style of architecture,
with large verandas in front and rear, a wide hallway, with
two rooms on either side, and wings supplementing these. The
rooms are spacious, and are eleven in number, besides pantry,
storeroom, kitchen, cellar. There is a smoke-house and other
outhouses. In 1922 a steam furnace was installed at a safe distance
from the mansion, eliminating danger of fire from this source.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig9">
<img src="images/p07.jpg" alt="The hall." width="800" height="609" />
</div>
<div class="divp"><h3><i>The Hall</i></h3>
The hall contains the original hat rack, umbrella stand,
two mahogany sofas, pier table, Brussels stair carpet
and brass rods, and the chandelier. The hall floor originally was
covered with oilcloth. The pictorial wallpaper was printed by
duFour in Paris, about 1825. The complete set consisted of
twenty-five strips in colors, and was ordered by General Jackson
in 1835, being the original paper used when the house was rebuilt.
It was shipped by way of New Orleans up the Mississippi and
Cumberland Rivers. This paper is of outstanding historical interest,
one of the few historic, scenic papers preserved in this country.</div>
<p>The paper represents the legend of the travels of Telemachus
<span class="pb" id="Page_42">42</span>
in search of Ulysses, his father, and is that part of the story of
his landing on the island of Calypso. He is accompanied by
Mentor.</p>
<dl class="case"><dd><span class="sc">Scene I.</span> The landing and the Queen advancing to meet them.</dd>
<dd><span class="sc">Scene II.</span> Telemachus relating the story of his travels to Calypso, the
faithful Mentor by his side.</dd>
<dd><span class="sc">Scene III.</span> Calypso gives a fete in his honor, and Cupid begins to play
a part.</dd>
<dd><span class="sc">Scene IV.</span> Telemachus resolves to escape; Calypso&rsquo;s maidens burn his boat,
and he jumps from the cliffs.</dd>
</dl>
<p>In October, 1930, the paper was removed from the walls by
Mr. James Wilson from the Metropolitan Museum in New York,
for the purpose of treating the walls to insure the preservation
of the paper, and was then put back.</p>

<div class="img" id="fig11">
<img src="images/p09.jpg" alt="The tomb." width="800" height="566" />
</div>
<p>The tomb was built by General Jackson in 1831 and was erected
over his wife, with a vault for himself.</p>
<p>The inscription on General Jackson&rsquo;s tomb is:</p>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">General Andrew Jackson</span>
<br />Born March 15, 1767
<br />Died June 8, 1845</p>
<p>The inscription on Mrs. Jackson&rsquo;s tomb was written by her
husband, and is as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Here lie the remains of Mrs. Rachel Jackson, wife of President Jackson, who died the 22nd
of December, 1828. Age, 61 years. Her face was fair, her person pleasing, her temper amiable,
her heart kind; she delighted in relieving the wants of her fellow creatures, and cultivated that
divine pleasure by the most liberal and unpretending methods; to the poor she was a benefactor;
to the rich an example; to the wretched a comforter; to the prosperous an ornament; her piety
went hand in hand with her benevolence, and she thanked her Creator for being permitted to do
good. A being so gentle and so virtuous slander might wound, but could not dishonor. Even
death, when he bore her from the arms of her husband, could but transport her to the bosom of
her God.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The other graves on the plot are those of the adopted son, Andrew
Jackson, Jr., and his wife, Mrs. Sarah York Jackson. Two infants
lie buried there; also one son, Samuel Jackson, who was killed at
<span class="pb" id="Page_55">55</span>
Chickamauga; the grave of Dr. John M. Lawrence, who married
Rachel, the idol of the old General&rsquo;s life. In February, 1923, the
spirit of Mrs. Rachel Jackson Lawrence passed into the great
beyond, and her body rests beside her husband and near her grandfather,
the great hero, who affectionately looked upon and called
her his &ldquo;beloved little Rachel.&rdquo; The grave of Col. R. E. W. Earl,
friend and companion of Jackson, is there. Further apart from the
other graves is that of Mrs. Marion Adams, the widowed sister of
Mrs. Sarah Jackson who always resided with her, and whose family
was reared at the Hermitage. On December 19, 1906, Col. Andrew
Jackson, grandson, was laid beside his kindred dust in the garden,
and his wife, Mrs. Amy Jackson, who died January 9, 1921, lies
beside him. There are also the graves of John Marshall Lawrence,
1859-1926, and Thomas Donelson Lawrence, 1869-1942, sons of
Mrs. Rachel Jackson Lawrence; and Anne Laurie Lawrence Smith,
born at the Hermitage April 3, 1855, died February 4, 1937, and
Sazie Lawrence Winn, born at Hermitage March 15, 1854, died
May 6, 1882, daughters of Mrs. Lawrence. Andrew Jackson, IV,
son of Col. Andrew and Mrs. Amy Jackson, was buried here in
1953.</p>
<p>The grave of Uncle Alfred, freed slave who preferred to remain
at the Hermitage and who wanted to be buried near General Jackson,
is located to the north of the tomb in the garden.</p>
<p>The stone seat near the tomb is one of three presented to the
Hermitage by Mrs. Marvin E. Holderness, Mr. Robert F. Jackson,
Jr., and Mr. N. Baxter Jackson of New York, in memory of their
mother, Mrs. Robert F. Jackson, who served as Regent of the
Ladies&rsquo; Hermitage Association. Mrs. Robert F. Jackson&rsquo;s grandmother,
Mrs. Mary L. Baxter, served as first Regent 1889-1899.</p>
<h3>THE SARCOPHAGUS OFFER</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>In March, 1845, Commodore Elliott offered to General Jackson a sarcophagus
which he had obtained at Palestine. In a letter of appreciation,
but ringing with American spirit, General Jackson declined the offer.</p>
<p>Copies of two letters touching this incident were presented to the Association
by Hon. John Wesley Gaines and are as follows:</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><span class="lr">Washington City, March 18, 1845.</span></p>
<p><i>My Dear General</i>&mdash;Last night I made something of a speech at the National
Institute, and have offered for their acceptance the sarcophagus which I
obtained at Palestine, brought home in the Constitution, and believed to
contain the remains of the Roman Emperor Alexander Severus, with the
<span class="pb" id="Page_56">56</span>
suggestion that it might be tendered you for your final resting place. I
pray you, General, to live on in the fear of the Lord; dying the death of a
Roman soldier, an emperor&rsquo;s coffin awaits you.</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">I am, truly, your friend.</p>
<p class="lr"><span class="sc">Jesse D. Elliott.</span></p>
<p class="t0">To Gen. Andrew Jackson.</p>
</div>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><span class="lr">Hermitage, Tenn., March 27, 1845.</span></p>
<p><i>Dear Sir</i>&mdash;Your letter of the 18th inst. tonight with a copy of the Proceedings
of the National Institute, furnished me by their corresponding
secretary, on the presentation by you of the sarcophagus for acceptance on
condition it shall be preserved and in honor of my memory, have been received
and are now before me. Although laboring under great debility and affliction,
from a severe attack from which I may not recover, I raise my pen and endeavor
to reply. The steadiness of my nerves may perhaps lead you to conclude
my prostration of strength is not so great as here expressed. Strange
as it may appear, my nerves are as steady as they were forty years gone by,
whilst from debility and affliction I am gasping for breath. I have read the
whole proceedings of the presentation by you of the sarcophagus, and the
resolutions passed by the board of directors so honorable to my fame, with
sensations and feelings more easily to be conjectured than by me expressed.
The whole proceedings call for my most grateful thanks which are hereby
extended to you, and through you to the president and directors of the
National Institute. BUT WITH THE WARMEST SENSATIONS THAT
CAN INSPIRE A GRATEFUL HEART, I MUST DECLINE ACCEPTING
THE HONOR INTENDED TO BE BESTOWED. I CANNOT CONSENT
THAT MY MORTAL BODY SHALL BE LAID IN A REPOSITORY
PREPARED FOR AN EMPEROR OR KING.</p>
<p>MY REPUBLICAN FEELINGS AND PRINCIPLES FORBID IT;
THE SIMPLICITY OF OUR SYSTEM OF GOVERNMENT FORBIDS IT.
EVERY MONUMENT ERECTED TO PERPETUATE THE MEMORY
OF OUR HEROES AND STATESMEN OUGHT TO BEAR EVIDENCE
OF THE ECONOMY AND SIMPLICITY OF OUR REPUBLICAN
INSTITUTIONS AND OF THE PLAINNESS OF OUR REPUBLICAN
CITIZENS, WHO ARE THE SOVEREIGNS OF OUR GLORIOUS
UNION AND WHOSE VIRTUE IT IS TO PERPETUATE IT. TRUE
VIRTUE CANNOT EXIST WHERE POMP AND PARADE ARE THE
GOVERNING PASSIONS. IT CAN ONLY DWELL WITH THE
PEOPLE&mdash;THE GREAT LABORING AND PRODUCING CLASSES&mdash;THAT
FORM THE BONE AND SINEW OF OUR CONFEDERACY.</p>
<p>For these reasons I cannot accept the honor you and the president and
directors of the National Institute intended to bestow. I CANNOT PERMIT
MY REMAINS TO BE THE FIRST IN THESE UNITED STATES TO BE
DEPOSITED IN A SARCOPHAGUS MADE FOR AN EMPEROR OR A
KING. I again repeat, please accept for yourself, and convey to the president
and directors of the National Institute, my most profound respects
for the honor you and they intended to bestow. I have prepared an humble
depository for my mortal body besides that wherein lies my beloved wife,
<span class="pb" id="Page_57">57</span>
where, without any pomp or parade, I have requested, when my God calls
me to sleep with my fathers, to be laid; for both of us there to remain until
the last trumpet sounds to call the dead to judgment, when we, I hope,
shall rise together, clothed with that heavenly body promised to all who
believe in our glorious Redeemer who died for us that we might live, and by
whose atonement I hope for a blessed immortality.</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">I am, with great respect, your friend and fellow citizen,</p>
<p class="lr"><span class="sc">Andrew Jackson</span>.</p>
<p class="t0">To Commodore J. D. Elliott, United States Navy.</p>
</div>
</blockquote>
<p>On January 8th, the anniversary of the Battle of New Orleans,
an annual pilgrimage is made to the tomb of Andrew Jackson by
the Association, school groups, patriotic and civil official organizations.
Representatives place wreaths on the tomb. The Andrew
Jackson State Park, commemorating his birthplace, is located 10
miles north of Lancaster, S. C.</p>
<p>Horseshoe Bend National Military Park, largely a memorial to
General Jackson, is located on the site of the Battle of Horseshoe
Bend, on the Tallapoosa River, east central Alabama.</p>
<div class="divp"><h3><i>Uncle Alfred&rsquo;s Cabin</i></h3>
Uncle Alfred was General Jackson&rsquo;s
body-servant and lived in his cabin in the
rear yard. Born in 1803, he lived until 1901, and for many years
entertained visitors when acting as guide through the Hermitage.
At his request, he is buried near the Jackson tomb in the garden.
This cabin has been furnished according to Uncle Alfred&rsquo;s time.
In one of the rooms of the cabin is an old spinning jinny (original)
presented by Mrs. W. B. Walton, a great-niece of Mrs. Jackson.
This was inherited by Mrs. Walton from the family.</div>
<div class="divp"><h3><i>Old Carriage House From Hunter&rsquo;s Hill</i></h3>
Log building used as a carriage house
during Jackson&rsquo;s residence at Hunter&rsquo;s
Hill, was moved from there and now located
near the spring, used as a tool house.</div>
<div class="divp"><h3><i>The Log House by the Spring</i></h3>
Completed in 1940, was built
for the use of the Hermitage
Association members. It consists of two spacious rooms and a
kitchen equipped for simple cooking. It is used for the annual
<div class="pb" id="Page_58">58</div>
spring and fall outings of the Association, and members have the
privilege of using the kitchen and one or both rooms for entertaining,
upon application to the custodian and payment of a small fee.
One of the rooms was furnished in memory of Mrs. Walter Stokes,
former Regent, by her daughter, Mrs. W. H. Wemyss, and her son,
Walter Stokes, Jr.</div>
<h3>GENUINENESS OF THE RELICS</h3>
<p>That there might never be a question raised as to the genuineness
of the relics purchased, the Association has obtained from Colonel
Jackson and his sister, Mrs. Rachel Jackson Lawrence, the following
affidavit:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>TO WHOM IT MAY CONCERN:</p>
<p>This is to certify that all the articles of furniture or relics purchased by the
Ladies&rsquo; Hermitage Association from Mrs. Rachel Jackson Lawrence, granddaughter,
and Col. Andrew Jackson, grandson of General Andrew Jackson
are the identical pieces of furniture owned and used by General Jackson
during his lifetime. They were in the Hermitage when General Jackson
died and were there when the Ladies&rsquo; Hermitage Association took possession
in 1889. The entire collection was removed in 1893, when Col. Jackson
left the Hermitage, and have been restored from time to time as the Association
was able to purchase them.</p>
<p>The articles restored up to the present time, March, 1900, are those in
General Jackson&rsquo;s bedroom, which is complete as it was the day he died;
the library, or office, entire; the hall, entire; and all furniture now in the
dining room and parlors.</p>
<p>(SEAL)
<span class="lr"><span class="sc">Rachel Jackson Lawrence.</span></span>
<span class="lr"><span class="sc">Col. Andrew Jackson.</span></span></p>
<p>Sworn to and subscribed before me, this March 13, 1900.
<span class="lr"><span class="sc">R. S. Cowan</span>, <i>Notary Public</i>.</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Since 1900 many more pieces of the Jackson furniture and relics have been
acquired and restored to the Hermitage by purchase, gift, or loan; and while
it is well furnished throughout with original pieces, information is still being
gathered and evaluated on some outstanding relics.</p>

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
